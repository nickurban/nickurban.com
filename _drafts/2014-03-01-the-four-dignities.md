<div class='alert alert-info'>
  This post is one in a series about the Shambhala teachings presented by Chogyam Trungpa.
  <br>
  In the previous post, I discussed the concept of 
  <em><a href='/2014-02-21-the-magic-of-drala'>drala</a></em>, 
  or elemental reality. 
</div>

In the symbolism of Shambhala, four animals appear over and over again. 
Each represents one of the "four dignities" or noble attributes of the warrior. 
The four dignities are one metaphor by which Trungpa identified the 
awake and uplifted experience that is cultiated through meditation.

### Meek

The first dignity Trungpa describes is Meekness, which is symbolized by the Tiger. 
This is not Blake's Tygre of Fearful Symmetry or a Nature Channel predator.
For Trungpa, the Tiger represents solidity, grounded awareness, and even gentleness.
The Tiger makes his way confidently and alertly through the jungles of life. 
He is relaxed and energized, seeing and respecting the world with self-sufficient modesty.

The meditative state that I associate with the Tiger is one of groundedness. 
It is the first of the four dignities that I invoke when I sit down to meditate.
It is a "tight" practice, where effort is made to calm and focus the mind.
I associate it with close attention to the breath and a relaxed downward gaze.

### Perky

The second dignity is Perkiness. It is the manifestation of brightness, uprightness, and good cheer.
In our normal life, we may be cheerful when things are going our way, and depressed when they are not.
Perkiness is not like that. It is unconditionally cheerful.

In Shambhala mythology, perkiness is symbolized by the Lion.
Manifesting the Lion means recognizing the indepenence of our mental states with outer circumstances.

When I invoke Perkiness in my meditation, I feel uplifted. My spine straightens and my head stretches towards the sky. 
My gaze lifts higher, my eyes smile, and my awareness spreads.

### Outrageous

The third dignity is "Outrageousness" and is associated with the Garuda, a mythical bird that hatches fullly formed.
Outrageousness is characterized by a sense of great spaciousness.
It has a sense of seeing further and clearer, of panoramic awareness. 
When I invoke Garuda, I open my eyes wider and have a light touch and sense of freedom from concern.

### Inscruitable

The last of the four dignities is "Inscruitability", symbolized by the Dragon.
Inscruitability is the fruition of the first three dignities.
It represents a sense of naturalness, playfulness, and humor.
The Dragon has a wholesomeness, authenticity, and fluidity of action that leaves no need for external validation.

Inscruitability does not have as obvious a correlate in meditaton as the first three dignities, but I have
some sense of what it means. It is a sense of letting go of the deliberate practices of the first three.
At this point, the first three have become natural and have melded into an organic expression of warriorship
free from ego. The Dragon represents the beginning of mastery, where no specific action is necessary
to manifest the Dharma, because it is expressed by one's very being.

### Living Drala

When a warrior embodies the Four Dignities, he is said to have become 'living drala'. 
This is the fruitition of meditation. Through it, one not only creates virtue and lucidity for oneself,
but projects an environment of warmth and presence which is felt by the world.

In this state, Trungpa said, "[one's] presence evokes the experience of the cosmic mirror"[^1].
Being around someone who manifests "living drala" evokes an encounter with elemental reality,
and so "Heaven and earth begin to dance"[^2].
