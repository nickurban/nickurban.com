This post is one in a series about the Shambhala teachings presented in Chogyam Trungpa's 
[Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior]. In my previous post I talked about the concept of *[drala]*. 

Today I will discuss the "four dignities" of warriorship: *meek*, *perky*, *outrageous*, and *inscruitable*. 

The four dignities are likewise represented by four animals: the tiger, the lion, the mythical garuda bird, and the dragon.

Each corresponds to certain characteristics that belong to the character of a warrior, 
as well (in my experience) to specific experiences found in meditation. 

Meekness is the first of the four dignitities, and it serves as their base. It is a feeling of solidity, of grounded awareness and gentleness.
Meekness is represented by the tiger. The image is not an aggressive one, but it is the way in which the tiger steps through
the jungle in full awareness, noticing everything that goes on around him. He is relaxed and energized, and has a sense of
self-sufficiency fused with modesty. 

In my mind, this corresponds to the feeling I have when I focus on the breath, on the bodily sensation of air going in and out.
When I sit down to meditate, I begin by feeling a connection to the ground below me. The tension falls from my body, and I relax,
supported by the earth.

The second dignity is called "perky". It is the manifestation of unconditional cheerfulness and dignity. 
In our normal life, we may be cheerful when things are going our way, and depressed or irritable if they are not.
Manifesting the second dignity means being cheerful no matter what our outer circumstances.
In Shambhala mythology, perkiness is associated with the lion.

When I invoke perkiness, I have a feeling of upliftedness. Literally my spine straightens and my head stretches towards the sky. 
My eyes lift higher and my awareness expands upward. In meekness, I connect to earth. In perkiness, I connect to heaven.

The third dignity is called "outrageousness" and is associated with the mythical garuda bird.
Outrageousness is characterized by an enormous sense of space.

Outrageousness if the dignity of the garuda bird, soaring high above the world. Garuda represents a sense of great spaciousness. Focus becomes broader. My eyes open wider and awareness spreads throughout the space. Vision becomes panoramic. Fearlessness. No hope or fear.

Last is the inscruitable dragon. This is the least obvious of the four dignities.

It is the culmination of the first three, but at the same time it has its own character. 

Inscruitability has a sense of playfulness and humor.

1. the state of inscruitability
2. the expression

Genuineness and wholesomeness without the need for confirmation; without hesitation.

In meditating on the dragon, I find a sense of jollyness. The whole drama of life on earth appears less seriously heavy and more fun.  

Expressing the truth, implying it with enlightened confidence rather than trying to spell it out or explain it.

When a warrior embodies all four of these qualities, he is said to have become "living drala". "His presence evokes the experience of the cosmic mirror (p. 176). "Heaven and earth begin to dance" (p. 177)
