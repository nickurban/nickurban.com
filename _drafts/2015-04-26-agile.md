# What "Agile" really means
# How Agile processes reduce the cost of software development

It wasn't very long ago that I thought "Agile Software Development" 
simply meant the absence of heavy "waterfall" development processes.

This seems to be a fairly wide-spread misconcception in the developer community.

Agile is not just the lack of waterfall. 

At ThoughtWorks, at any rate, it consists of specific techniques and processes,
implemented in a lightweight and self-aware way.

"People over process"

1. Inceptions - finding your unknown unknowns, bridging the silos
2. Sprint Planning - Estimation, prioritization
3. Standups - just a quick status check
4. Pairing
5. TDD
6. Continuous Integration
7. Continuous Delivery

Trunk-based development
Code Reviews?
Branch by abstraction
Feature-toggles
Zero-downtime deployments

Containerization
