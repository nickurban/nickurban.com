title: Why every business should consider custom software for its core processes

Business software exists to solve problems. 
It exists to move some small corner of the world from a less-favorable to a 
more-favorable state. By doing work that is too tedious, time-consuming, 
and error-prone for people to do, it frees those people to focus on more important things.

When looking for software, there is always a choice between prefabricated and custom solutions.

For general applications, like a word processor or spreadsheet, off-the-shelf software usually serves well. 
It does a good job, and employees often already know how to use it.

Each approach has advantages: custom solutions are usually more optimized for the company's particular workflow, and off-the-shelf solutions offer a broader based of general features. In some cases, off-the-shelf software is cheaper, but not always. Even if off-the-shelf software has a lower acquisition cost, it often includes slow and inappropriate design for a given problem, making it a penny-wise and pound-foolish choice.

- Software is complex because businesses are complex.
- But different businesses are complex in different ways. 
- It would be quite wasteful and confusing to import the complexity of other businesses into your processes, but this is exactly what happens when you use off-the-shelf software.
- Off-the-shelf software attempts to be a one-size-fits-all solution, which is fine for general applications like word processing, but for the core functions of a business, such as sales, process management, or data processing, the inefficiency and confusion can add up to substantial waste and costly errors.
- Because custom software is designed specifically for your company, it contains highly-optimized workflows which increase both productivity and morale (no more clicking through 10 screens to accomplish a simple task).
- Many people assume that that building custom software is the equivalent of "reinventing the wheel". However, software is rarely built "from the ground up". Instead, it's a matter of correctly analyzing the business case and intelligently assembling the right components for the job. 
- Even if you choose an off-the-shelf application, you may _still_ need custom software to connect it to your other applilcations and data sources.
- Because off-the-shelf software usually can't be changed, adapting it to existing application is often more complex and less performant than custom software, which can be easily changed.


- Custom software is flexible and naturally grows with your business. As you integrate new revenue streams, partnerships, and technological systems, your custom software can be adapted and optimized. Off-the-shelf solution would require much effort to integrate their poorly matching interfaces. 
- When you hire a firm like <$COMPANY_NAME>, you acquire not only a business solution, but technologically-minded partners who are aware of the latest developments in the software world. Because we understand our clients' systems, we can help them keep on top of the changing software landscape, and recommend changes that would result in quick wins.

It often makes sense to use custom software, because any friction introduced into a crucial function reduces the profits of the company.
