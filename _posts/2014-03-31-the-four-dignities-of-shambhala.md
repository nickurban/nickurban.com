<div class='alert alert-info'>
  This post is one in a series about the Shambhala teachings presented by 
  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chogyam_Trungpa'>Chogyam Trungpa</a>.
  <br>
  In the <a href='/blog/the-magic-of-drala'>previous post</a>,
  I discussed the concept of <em>drala</em> or elemental reality. 
</div>

In the symbolism of [Shambhala], four animals appear over and over again:
The Tiger, the Lion, the Garuda, and the Dragon.
Each represents one of the "four dignities" or noble attributes of the warrior. 
The four dignities are a metaphor by which Trungpa describes the 
awake and uplifted experience that is cultiated through meditation.

### Meek

The first dignity Trungpa describes is Meekness, which is symbolized by the Tiger. 
This is not Blake's Tygre of Fearful Symmetry or a Nature Channel predator.
For Trungpa, the Tiger represents solidity, grounded awareness, and even gentleness.
The Tiger makes his way confidently and alertly through the jungles of life. 
He is relaxed and energized, seeing and respecting the world with self-sufficient modesty.

The meditative state that I associate with the Tiger is one of simple awareness. 
It is the first of the four dignities that I invoke when I sit down to meditate.
It is a "tight" practice, where effort is made to gather and focus the mind.
I associate it with close attention to the breath and a relaxed downward gaze.

### Perky

The second dignity is Perkiness. It is the manifestation of brightness, uprightness, and good cheer.
In our normal life, we may be cheerful when things are going our way, and depressed when they are not.
Perkiness is not like that. It is unconditionally cheerful.

In Shambhala mythology, perkiness is symbolized by the Lion.
Manifesting the Lion means recognizing the indepenence of our mental states with outer circumstances.

When I invoke Perkiness in my meditation, I feel uplifted. My spine straightens and my head stretches upwards.
My gaze lifts closer to horizontal, my eyes smile, and my awareness spreads somewhat compared to the "tight" practice of the Tiger. 

### Outrageous

The third dignity is "Outrageousness" and is associated with the Garuda, the mythical kind of birds who was born fully formed.
Outrageousness is characterized by a sense of great spaciousness and of soaring high above earthly problems.
He has a sense of seeing further and clearer -- of panoramic awareness. 
When I invoke Garuda, I open my eyes wider and picture my life from a thousand-foot view. This gives me a feeling of lightness and possibility. It makes my problems seem small and possibilities great.

### Inscruitable

The last of the four dignities is "Inscruitability", symbolized by the Dragon.
Inscruitability is the fruition of the first three dignities.
It represents a sense of naturalness, playfulness, and humor.
The Dragon has a wholesomeness, authenticity, and fluidity of action that creates a sense of confidence beyond the need for external validation.

Inscruitability is the process of incorporating and hence letting go of the explicit practice of the first three dignities. In inscruitability, the first three dignities have become natural and have melded into a graceful and organic expression of warriorship. The Dragon represents a stage of mastery, where Dharma is expressed by one's very being.

### Living Drala

When a warrior embodies the Four Dignities, he is said to have become "living drala". 
This is the fruitition of meditation. Through it, one not only creates virtue and lucidity for oneself,
but projects an environment of warmth and presence which is felt by the world.

In this state, "[one's] presence evokes the experience of the cosmic mirror" --
the pure phenomena of reality, unfiltered by any self-interested agenda. When that happens, Trungpa says, "Heaven and earth begin to dance."[^1]
