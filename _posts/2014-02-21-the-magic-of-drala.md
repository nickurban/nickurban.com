Lately I have been reading [_Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior_], 
by [Chogyam Trungpa]. With a subtitle like that, you might suspect 
it to be a book of new-age platitudes, but it is far from that.
It is an articulate philosophy of life which seeks to recover,
within a secular context, the dignity, lucidity, and wonder of life. 

One concept which particularly stuck out for me is that of _drala_.

Trungpa defines "drala" as the "magical quality of experience" or "the unconditioned wisdom and power of of the world that are beyond any dualism". [^1] 

If you have ever had a moment that felt deep, immediate and mysterious, you have experienced drala. 

But drala is not only an abstract concept. It is used to refer to any thing in the world when felt in its fullest aspect. To 'meet the dralas' is to see the sky, vividly, as the sky, or to feel the vastness of a redwood grove. The experience is reverential. It resembles [animism], except that the 'spirituality' of beings is understood phenomenologically (as a quality of experience) rather than ontologically (as if there are special beings 'out there' independent of us that give the world its spiritual qualities).

The magical quality of experience is available to us any time if we open 
ourselves to it through meditation.

> By relaxing the mind, you can reconnect with that primordial, original ground, which is completely pure and simple. Out of that, through the medium of your perceptions, you can discover magic, or drala. You actually can connect your own intrinsic wisdom with a sense of greater wisdom or vision beyond you.[^2]

Human beings have a profound desire to feel connected to something beyond themselves.
Without such a feeling, they tend to become narcissistic and nihilistic.
However, many people have trouble accepting the belief in supernatural beings.

That does not mean that those people are doomed, however, for what is 
needed is not _belief_, but experience -- the type of experience which we 
ususally call 'divine' or 'sacred'.

Interestingly, that quality of experience is available to us whether or not we believe that it comes from a supernatural source. It may be a natural part of human consciousness.  The _drala_ that Trungpa describes, as I understand it, is exactly this 'divinity' of experience. 

The experience of drala often feels supernatural, and it may be convenient to speak as if it were, but there is no need to _rationally assent_ that it is so.[^3] This is wonderful, for it makes the profound experience of life available to everyone, regardless of their beliefs.

These teachings grow out of the Buddhist tradition,
a tradition in which metaphysical questions are of secondary importance.[^4]
The Buddha, when asked about some of the controverial metaphysical dilemmas of his day,
famously [remained silent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_unanswered_questions).
Buddhist teachings are described as a raft which carries one across the river of life.
"Gone... gone to the other shore," as the [Heart Sutra] says.
When one reaches the shore, to carry a raft further would be a hindrance.

There is the sun, the sky, the earth.
One puts down the boat of concepts and dwells among the dralas.
